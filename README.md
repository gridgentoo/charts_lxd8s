This repo collects all my projects' Helm charts to one place. Some are pushed in from other repositories
automatically.

When a chart is updated, it will be indexed automatically onto the `gh-pages` branch, which can be accessed as a chart
repo at https://netsoc.github.io/charts/. Run the following to add the repo to your system:

```bash
helm repo add devplayer0 https://devplayer0.github.io/charts/
```
